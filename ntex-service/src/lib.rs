#[allow(unused_variables)]
/// An asynchronous function of `Request` to a `Response`.
///
/// The `Service` trait represents a request/response interaction, receiving requests and returning
/// replies. You can think about service as a function with one argument that returns some result
/// asynchronously. Conceptually, the operation looks like this:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// async fn(Request) -> Result<Response, Error>
/// ```
///
/// The `Service` trait just generalizes this form. Requests are defined as a generic type parameter
/// and responses and other details are defined as associated types on the trait impl. Notice that
/// this design means that services can receive many request types and converge them to a single
/// response type.
///
/// Services can also have mutable state that influence computation by using a `Cell`, `RefCell`
/// or `Mutex`. Services intentionally do not take `&mut self` to reduce overhead in the
/// common cases.
///
/// `Service` provides a symmetric and uniform API; the same abstractions can be used to represent
/// both clients and servers. Services describe only _transformation_ operations which encourage
/// simple API surfaces. This leads to simpler design of each service, improves test-ability and
/// makes composition easier.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use std::convert::Infallible;
/// #
/// # use ntex_service::{Service, ServiceCtx};
///
/// struct MyService;
///
/// impl Service<u8> for MyService {
///     type Response = u64;
///     type Error = Infallible;
///
///     async fn call(&self, req: u8, ctx: ServiceCtx<'_, Self>) -> Result<Self::Response, Self::Error> {
///         Ok(req as u64)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Sometimes it is not necessary to implement the Service trait. For example, the above service
/// could be rewritten as a simple function and passed to [`fn_service`](fn_service()).
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// async fn my_service(req: u8) -> Result<u64, Infallible>;
/// ```
///
/// Service cannot be called directly, it must be wrapped to an instance of [`Pipeline``] or
/// by using `ctx` argument of the call method in case of chanined services.
///
